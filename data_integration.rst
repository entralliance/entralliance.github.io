Warehousing Guidelines (Integrating New Project Data)
*****************************************************

How to integrate data for new wind plants. For Q3 deliverable, just the csv method. We can add additional methods later. Includes where to save new csv files and how to update models. 

* Where to put new csv files (eventually how to bring in external db data)
* Steps for mapping new data to appropriate dimensions, building staging models, and integrating in generic ENTR fact tables
    * Steps for creating new ENTR tags if none match data brought in by users and contribution guidelines for adding those to the ENTR-maintained tag list (link to :doc:`contributing`?)
* Eventually this can describe the process for adding pre-processing steps.
