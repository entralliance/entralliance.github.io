Running OpenOA Examples
***********************

Jupyter notebooks demonstrating operational wind plant data analyses using OpenOA with example data stored in the ENTR warehouse are located at /examples in the `ENTR OpenOA repository <https://github.com/entralliance/OpenOA>`_. All examples use two years of data for the 4-turbine `"La Haute Borne" <https://opendata-renewables.engie.com>`_ wind plant.

TODO: Some introduction to how to navigate to and run the OpenOA example notebooks in the Docker container.
