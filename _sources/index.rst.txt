Welcome to the ENTR Foundation docs site!

This documentation can be used to learn more about the technology built by the ENTR Foundation to support our mission of establishing open data standards for the clean energy industry.

If interested visit `<https://www.entrfoundation.org>`_ to find out more about ENTR, or navigate to the sections below about how to get started on using the ENTR data stack and how to get involved with the ENTR community.

The ENTR Data Stack
===================


The ENTR Foundation maintains several open-source code repositories that were built to integrate flexibly with enterprise data systems. Our software provides the following high-level functionality:

1. An opinionated way to structure and name tabular data for the renewable energy industry
2. A framework for building analytical tools upon that opinionated foundation
